# TextSim-Embeddings
TextSim-Embeddings is a tool that leverages OpenAI's embeddings to calculate and compare the semantic similarity between different pieces of text using cosine similarity. Input your text, generate embeddings, and see how closely related each text is based on meaning. Ideal for clustering, semantic search, and more!
